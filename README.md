Aioli is a Framework for building RESTful HTTP and WebSocket APIs.
Its easy-to-use component system, which was built with emphasis on portability and composability, provides a sensible separation of application logic, data access and request/response layers.

Furthermore, it makes use of asyncio, is lightweight, and provides high performance and concurrencyâ€“especially for IO-bound workloads.

Note that Aioli only works only with modern versions of Python (3.6+) and is *Event loop driven*, i.e. code must be [asynchronous](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
