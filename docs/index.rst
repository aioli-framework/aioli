About
=====

Aioli was created with usability, extensibility and performance in mind, and is used for building modular, fast and highly concurrent web backend applications of any size.

It works with modern versions of Python (3.6+), is *event loop driven* and makes use of `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ with `uvloop <https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop>`_.
