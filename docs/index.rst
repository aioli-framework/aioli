About
=====

The idea with Aioli is to provide developers with a sensible base
structure and set of tools for building *performant*, *lightweight* and
*scalable* HTTP API packages that can be easily deployed or distributed.

Itâ€™s built on top of `aiohttp`_ and uses the *blazing fast* `uvloop`_
implementation of the asyncio event loop.

Features and limitations:

- Delivers performance and concurrency
- Scales horizontally
- Supports CORS and JWT out of the box
- Has built-in support for `Postgres`_ databases
- Provides intuitive tools for object serialization
- Created with `Docker`_ and `Kubernetes`_ in mind
- Works only with modern versions of Python (3.6+)
- Event loop driven; code must be `asynchronous`_
