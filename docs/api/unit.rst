Unit
=======


The *Unit* class is used for grouping and labeling a set of :ref:`Controllers <controller-docs>` and :ref:`Services <service-docs>`.
These components typically contain code that makes sense to modularize in the Application at hand.

Check out the :ref:`Extensions docs <extensions-docs>` to learn how Units can be connected.
