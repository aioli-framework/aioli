The idea with these examples, or snippets if you will, is to show how components *can* be built using the Aioli Framework.

If you're looking for a fully functional example; check out `The Guestbook example <https://github.com/aioli-framework/aioli-guestbook-example>`_ â€“ a Comprehensive RESTful HTTP API
package.
